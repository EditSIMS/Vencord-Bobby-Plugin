# Vencord-Bobby-Plugin

This is just a repo to contain files for my Vencord plugin, As using file imports isn't very supported.

# CONSOLE VERSION

To run the console version, simply paste this in the console:

```js
fetch("https://github.com/EditSIMS/Vencord-Bobby-Plugin/blob/main/bobby.js")
  .then(r => r.text())
  .then(js => eval(js));
```
